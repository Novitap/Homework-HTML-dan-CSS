            Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao born March 3, 1997 is a Cuban-born American singer, songwriter and actress. She
        rose to prominence as a member of the girl group Fifth Harmony, formed on The X Factor USA in 2012, signing a
        joint record deal with Syco Music and Epic Records. While in Fifth Harmony, Cabello began to establish herself
        as a solo artist with the release of the collaborations "I Know What You Did Last Summer" with Shawn Mendes, and
        "Bad Things" with Machine Gun Kelly, the latter reaching number four on the US Billboard Hot 100. After leaving
        the group in late 2016, Cabello released several other collaborations, including "Hey Ma" with Pitbull and J
        Balvin for The Fate of the Furious soundtrack (2017), and her debut solo single "Crying in the Club".

        Cabello's debut studio album, Camila (2018), reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart. The Latin
        music-influenced pop album was critically well-received, and received a Platinum certification by the Recording
        Industry Association of America (RIAA). Its lead single "Havana" topped the charts in several countries
        including the US and UK, and follow-up single "Never Be the Same" reached the top ten in multiple countries.
        Cabello's 2019 duet with Mendes, "Se√±orita", became her second single to top the Billboard Hot 100. Her second
        studio album, Romance (2019), peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 chart and number one in Canada.
        Cabello is set to star in an upcoming film adaptation of Cinderella (2021), for Sony Pictures.
